 * @brief       Driver and pattern generations functions for driving addressable
 *              leds.
 * @version     0.9
 * @date        2022-08-07

 *
 * This file provides a c++ driver class to drive adressable LEDs. The driver
 * currently only supports WS2812 leds. 
 * Asides driving the hardware, this library further provides a structure to 
 * schedule the display of patterns. A Pattern is a sequence of led blinkings. 
 * The pattern must be provided as a function. The function must have a pointer 
 * as argument (can be $NULL if the function does not use it). This pointer is 
 * usually used to point to a specific argument or an argument list and cast 
 * accordingly. To ensure consistency across runs this argument pointer is 
 * recorded in the pattern structures. 
 * If a function dynamically allocates memory that remains allocated across 
 * executions of the pattern, a clenaup function must be provided as well in 
 * order to prevent memory leaks. Note that once a pattern is successfully put
 * forward for displaying, all of the datastructures are now owned by the LED
 * pattern display thread. Under no circumstance you shall reuse any 
 * dynamically allocated memory references. The pattern structure itself can be 
 * safely delted or reused, as it was copied when sent to the LED display 
 * thread. For convenience, a pattern generator is provided. This allows the 
 * generation of patterns consisting of a list of states with execution time. 
 * This allows dynamic pattern generation. I the pattern is known at time of 
 * programming then it should be preffered to directly provide a function 
 * rather than using the generator, as this usually is more efficient.
 *
 * @bug FIXED - LEDs (almost) all white when concurrent mode and log level 
 *      warning or when integrating rmt initialisation in code directly in init 
 *      function. Similar to: https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/5237
 *      Fix: Initialisation of flags in rmt_config_t was missing.
 * 
 * @todo
 *      - Ensure that max bits per channel is 32
 *      - Adapt to new RMT driver
